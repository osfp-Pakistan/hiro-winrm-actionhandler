== Setup ==

=== Installation ===

==== Activate the SCL channel/repository ====
* On RHEL, execute
[source,sh]
----
subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-6-server-optional-rpms
subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-server-rhscl-6-rpms
----

* On CentOS, execute
[source,sh]
----
yum -y install centos-release-scl-rh
----

==== Add the hiro-contrib repository ====
Add the following to your `/etc/yum.repos.d/hiro.repo` file:
[source,conf]
----
[hiro-contrib]
name=arago HIRO contributions
baseurl=https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@repository.arago.de/hiro-contrib/centos/6/
gpgcheck=0
enabled=1
----
Replace `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` with your repository credentials.

[TIP]
====
* For **Free Edition:** The repository credentials or the same as
for your https://accounts.graphit.co[arago ID].
* For **Enterprise Edition:** You use your [underline]#arago ID#
credentials. Usually the AI Projects team will provide you with a
separate user for repository access.
====


[TIP]
====
To use the online RPM repository the target servers need to be able to connect to [underline]#tcp/443# on "repository.arago.de".
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
If your username/password contains special characters
you must replace them with the proper http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.asp[URL encode] character.
====

==== Install and start the ActionHandler ====
[source,sh]
----
yum install hiro_integration-winrm-actionhandler

service hiro-winrm-actionhandler start
service hiro-winrm-actionhandler status
----

=== Configure Kerberos ===

[IMPORTANT]
====
This part is not finished, yet.

=== Configure the HIRO Engine ===
Add the following section to your `/opt/autopilot/conf/aae.yaml` and restart the engine.
[source,yaml]
----
ActionHandlers:
  ActionHandler:
    - URL: tcp://127.0.0.1:7289
      SubscribeURL: ''
      CapabilityYAML: /opt/autopilot/conf/external_actionhandlers/capabilities/winrm-actionhandler.yaml
      RequestTimeout: 60
----

=== Configure the WinRM ActionHandler ===
To adjust the number of actions that can be executed concurrently
(both in total and per MARSNode), edit
`/opt/autopilot/conf/external_actionhandlers/winrm-actionhandler.conf`
[source,conf]
----
[ActionHandler]
ZMQ_URL: tcp://*:7289
ParallelTasks: 10
ParallelTasksPerWorker: 5
WorkerMaxIdle: 300
----

[width="100%",options="header"]
|====
| Option| Default| Meaning

| ParallelTasks| 10| Number of overall commands the ActionHandler will execute in parallel. Additional commands will be enqueued.
| ParallelTasksPerWorker| 5| Number of commands the ActionHandler will execute in parallel on the same target machine.
|====

To apply the changes, restart the ActionHandler
[source,sh]
----
service hiro-winrm-actionhandler restart

== Usage ==
The WinRM ActionHandler provides two 'Capabilities':

* `ExecuteCommand`: Execute standard DOS commands
* `ExecutePowershell`: Execute Powershell commands

Both capabilities support the execution of small scripts in their
respective language (DOS batch or Powershell).

IMPORTANT: The length of the whole script including all whitespace and line breaks
must not exceed 4096 characters.

`ExecuteCommand` is named exactly like in the Unix ActionHandler for
a reason: It does the same thing, executing a command.

Both ActionHandlers are limited by their `Applicability`. The Unix
ActionHandler will only work with Unix machines, the WinRM handler
only with Windows machines. Which one is used for execution depends
on the `MachineClass` of the `MARSNode` the `AutomationIssue`
resides on when the ActionHandler is called.

To learn more about `Capabilities` and `Applicabilities`, please
refer to the https://docs.hiro.arago.co/hiro/5.4.2/install-config/completing/generic-ah.html[documentation of the Generic ActionHandler].


=== Example ===
Usage is analogous to the Unix ActionHandlers:
